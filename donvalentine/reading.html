            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Donald Thomas Valentine</p>
            <p><strong>Domain:</strong> Venture Capital, Technology Allocation, Founder Selection</p>
            <p><strong>Era:</strong> Late 20th – Early 21st century</p>

            <br>

            <p><strong>Why he matters:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Don Valentine helped shape the technological backbone of the modern world by deciding, earlier than almost anyone else, which founders were worth trusting before proof was available. At a time when venture capital was still loosely defined, he imposed a discipline rooted not in storytelling or financial engineering, but in judgment — about people, problems, and timing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Valentine believed that capital was not neutral. Misallocated, it wasted decades. Allocated correctly, it accelerated civilisation. He built Sequoia Capital around this belief, rejecting consensus, committees, and fashionable narratives in favour of clear thinking and founder integrity. He backed operators who could explain hard problems plainly, pursue them relentlessly, and remain coherent under pressure.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The companies associated with him — Intel, Apple, Cisco, Nvidia — were not selected because their outcomes were obvious. They were selected because their internal logic aligned with the direction technology was moving, even when markets could not yet see it. Valentine did not attempt to manage these companies. He selected them, trusted them, and stayed out of their way.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He understood that the future is not predicted.
            </p>

        <div class="modal-content">

            <p><strong>1. Judgment Over Intelligence</strong></p>
            <p>Valentine was not the smartest person in the room — and he didn't want to be.<br>
                He optimised for judgment: the ability to decide with incomplete information and live with the consequences.</p>
            <br><hr class="modal-divider"><br>

            <p><strong>2. Clarity Intolerance</strong></p>
            <p>He believed confusion was disqualifying.</p>
            <p>If a founder couldn’t explain a hard problem plainly, Valentine assumed they didn't understand it yet.</p>
            <br><hr class="modal-divider"><br>

            <p><strong>3. Ruthless Filtration</strong></p>
            <p>Most meetings ended quickly.</p>
            <p>This wasn't impatience — it was protection.</p>
            <p>Time, he believed, was the scarcest input.</p>
            <br><hr class="modal-divider"><br>

            <p><strong>4. Founder Trust Asymmetry</strong></p>
            <p>Entry standards were brutal.</p>
            <p>Once inside, interference was minimal.</p>
            <p>He backed people, not processes.</p>
            <br><hr class="modal-divider"><br>

            <p><strong>5. Conviction Before Consensus</strong></p>
            <p>Valentine moved before agreement formed.</p>
            <p>When everyone else saw safety, he saw saturation.</p>
            <p>When others hesitated, he selected.</p>

            <p><strong>1: Backing Founders Before Markets</strong></p>
            <p>He invested before categories existed.</p>
            <p>People first. Markets later.</p>

            <br><hr class="modal-divider"><br>

            <p><strong>2: Building Sequoia Around Judgment, Not Process</strong></p>
            <p>No committees. No consensus theatre.</p>
            <p>Decisions were personal — and owned.</p>

            <br><hr class="modal-divider"><br>

            <p><strong>3: Funding What He Didn’t Fully Understand</strong></p>
            <p>He didn’t need technical mastery.</p>
            <p>He needed intellectual honesty and internal coherence.</p>

            <br><hr class="modal-divider"><br>

            <p><strong>4: Staying Out of the Way</strong></p>
            <p>Once committed, he withdrew.</p>
            <p>Control destroys compounding.</p>

            <p><strong>5: Saying No Relentlessly</strong></p>

            <p>It was the refusal.</p>

            <p>The period where conviction was expensive.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Personal computers were unproven.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Semiconductors were volatile.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Venture capital had no clear rulebook.</p>

            <p>Most capital waited for categories to form.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Valentine did not.</p><br>
                <p>This was his pressure node:</p><br>
                <p>Wait for proof and follow consensus, or commit early and risk being wrong alone?</p><br>
                <p>Backing founders before markets existed meant years of ambiguity.</p><br>
                <p>No benchmarks. No validation. No safety net.</p><br>
                <p>Only judgment.</p><br>
                <p>He chose to decide early —</p><br>

                <p>No committees to hide behind.</p><br>

                <p>If the call was wrong, it was his.</p><br>
            <p><strong>He committed.</strong></p>

            <p>Don Valentine understood that capital is power, and power exercised loudly corrodes. So he operated quietly — trusting fewer people, making fewer decisions, and living with uncertainty longer than most.</p>
